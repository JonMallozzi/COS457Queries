9. A table with all sname values such that for every bill x,
if x has ever been the subject of a roll call vote, then 
sname has voted on some roll call vote involving x. Note,
if the bill x was voted on in >1 roll call, sname need not
have cast a ballot in all of the roll calls, but just in some
one of them.

Eliminate duplicates and order by sname.

To obtain full credit you must use exists/not exists.

Hint:  the following set up can be made to work

select x.sname
from senators x
where  not exists(select 1
                  from legislation y
                  where y has been voted on in some roll call
                     and x has never cast a ballot on a roll call
                         involving y
                 )
order by x.sname;

with appropriate nested queries with external references to x and
and y.
