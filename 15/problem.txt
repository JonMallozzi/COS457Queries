15. Recall, every roll call is identified by a legnum and a vdate.  

Produce a table with a row for each roll call with columns

vdate of the roll call

legnum of the roll call

moneyfor   the sum of all contributions made strictly prior to the roll call
by corporations favorably affected by legnum(0 if none)

moneyagainst  the sum of all contributions made strictly prior to the roll 
call by corporations unfavorably affected by legnum(0 if none) 

passed  true if the count of Yea votes in the roll call is greater than the sum of the
counts of Nay and Abstain votes in the roll call, else false

moneyTalks true if (moneyfor > moneyagainst and passed) or (moneyagainst >
moneyfor and passed = false), else false

Eliminate duplicates and order by vdate, legnum.


You should use WITH to build up to this gradually.
