12. Redo #7 using the WITH construct to contruct two initial tables.  One
with all (cname, sname, sum) triples where cname is a corporation, sname
is a senator, and sum is the sum of all contributions from cname to sname,
or 0 if there are none, the other with all 
(cname, favaffecting, unfavaffecting) triples where cname is a corporation
and the other two components are y and z from #7.  Use the same column
labels from #7 so the results should be identical.

Eliminate duplicates and order by cname.

Hint: even with the two precalculated tables, you will need to do a nested
select to obtain the average of all contributions made by the corporation.
