13. Recall a roll call is identified by (vdate, legnum) pair that occurs
in a row of votes.  Produce a table with all

(vdate, legnum, ryeas, rnays, rabs, dyeas, dnays, dabs, oyeas, onays, oabs)

eleven-tuples where vdate,legnum are a roll call, ryeas is the count of
Republican Yea votes on that roll call, rnays the count of Republican Nays,
rabs is the count of Republican Abstains, and the d- and o- columns
are the analogous counts for the Democrats and neither Republican
nor Democrat categories (o for "other").

Eliminate duplicates and order by vdate, legnum.

There are many ways to do this, but the slickest and perhaps most efficient is
to do a single group by on votes joined with senators using clever case
expressions to count the correct values for the tally columns.
