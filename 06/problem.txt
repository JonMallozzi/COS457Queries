6. Produce a table with all sextuples (sname, u, v, w, x, y, z)
where sname is a senator and

u is the number of roll calls (identified by a (legnum, vdate) pair
  that the senator attended and cast a vote (including Abstain)
v is the number of times the senator voted Yea on a roll call
w is the number of times the senator voted Nay on a roll call
x is the date of the most recent Yea vote cast, or 'n/a' if v is 0
y is the date of the most recent Nay vote cast, or 'n/a' if w is 0
z is the date of the earliest Abstain vote cast, or 'n/a' if sname
  never voted Abstain

Eliminate duplicates and order by sname.

To obtain full credit you must use outer join with group by and
aggregate operators.

Every senator should have exactly one row.

Hint: you can use the case expression within the aggregate expression to
obtain some of the counts that involve filters.  Some may require you
to cast the result to varchar before using coalesce.
