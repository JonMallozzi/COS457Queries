4. Produce a table with all (cname, u, v, w, x, y, z) septuples
where cname is the name of a corporation that has made at least one
contribution and whose average contribution is at least as large as
the average of all contributions, and

u is the date of the first contribution by cname
v is the date of the most recent contribution by cname
w is number of contributions cname has made
x is the sum of the amounts of those contributions
y is the average amount of those contributions
z is the number of different senators that cname has contributed to

You may assume that the contributes table is not empty, so there will
be an average contribution amount.

Eliminate duplicates and order by cname.

To obtain full credit you must use group by with aggregate operators
and a having clause to filter the groups.
