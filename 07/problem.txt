7. Produce a table with all (cname, u, v, w, x, y, z)
septuples where cname is the name of a corporation and

u is the number of distinct senators that cname has contributed to
v is the maximum, over all sums of contributions to individual senators,
  that cname made, that is, suppose you had a table with two columns

  senator1   sum of cname's contributions to senator1
  senator2   sum of cname's contributions to senator2
  senator3   sum of cname's contributions to senator3
  ... 

  v would be the maximum of the second column, or 0 if
  cname made no contributions to any senators
w is like v, only the minimum of the second column; again, 0 if
  cname made no contributions to any senator
x is the average of all contributions cname has made, 0 if
  none were made
y is the count of bills that favorably affect cname
z is the count of bills that unfavorably affect cname

Eliminate duplicates and order by cname.

To obtain full credit, the query should have the structure

select c.cname,
   (nested selected for u) as u,
   coalesce((nested select for v), 0) as v,
   ...etc.
from corporations c
order by c.cname;

that is, all the values u through z must be obtained within the
select list using primarily nested select statements with an 
external reference to c.cname.  Most are straightforward.
v and w are quite tricky, but can be accomplished with 
a group by including a having clause which uses the
relationalOp all to find the maximum and minimum of the sums.
