8.  A table with all (sen1, sen2) pairs where sen1 and sen2 are two
different senator snames, with sen1 < sen2, and sen1 and sen2 were 
present for exactly the same subset of roll calls, that is for 
every roll call rc, sen1 cast a vote in rc iff sen2 cast a vote in rc.
Recall, a roll call is identified by a (legnum, vdate) pair that 
occurs in a row of the votes table.

Eliminate duplicates and order by sen1, sen2.

To obtain full credit, you must use the not exists contruct.

Note, this defines an equivalence relation on senators.

Hint: basically you do not want to find a roll call where sen1 voted
and sen2 did not, nor a roll call where sen2 voted and sen1 did not.
