5. Produce a table with all (sname, u, v, w, x) quintuples where sname
is a senator and the rest are boolean values, specifically

u is true if sname sponsors a bill, else false
v is true if sname opposes a bill, else false
w is true if sname has received a contribution else false
x is true if sname has cast a vote that is either Yea or Nay, else false

Eliminate duplicates and order by sname.

To obtain full credit you use outer joins in the from clause, no where 
clause filter, and appropriate expressions in the select list to obtain the
other columns.  No need to aggregate here and no aggregate operators should
be used.
