# QUERY PROBLEMS

## This is a repo containing the SQL code for the query problems in USM's fall 2019 database class offered by the COS Department ##


Inside each folder labled by the problem number there is the a txt file for the problem directions, correct output for problem, output the code gives, and the sql query code

The run script checks to see if each query outputs the correct result matching the output text file

the build script builds the final requried submission file for the class in format that the professor required
