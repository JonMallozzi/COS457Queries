14. This query is intended to measure the extent of partisanship on
a particular roll call vote, that is, mark the vote as showing
a great partisan divide.  Ignore abstentions, and for each roll call
count the Yea's and Nay's for the two major parties, Democrat and Republican.
Produce a table of (legnum, vdate, w, x, y, z, partisan) septuples where

a. legnum, vdate identify the roll call
b. w is 'Yea' if the there were more Democratic Yea votes than Nay votes,
   'Nay' if more Democratic Nay votes than Yea votes, and 'Even' if the counts were
   the same.
c. x is the fraction of Democratic vote counts that went with the prevailing
   vote of the party, or 0.500, if the the counts were even; for example, 
   suppose there were 30 Democrat Yeas and 10 Democrat Nays.  Then
   30/(30 + 10), which is 0.75, is the fraction of the vote that went with
   the prevailing vote.
d. y is analogous to w, but for Republicans
e. z is analogous to x, but for Republicans
f. partisan is true exactly when w and y are neither of them  'Even' and are
   not equal, and x and z are both >= 0.6

Eliminate duplicates and order by legnum and vdate.

Hint: You should be able to adapt the solution to the previous query to
obtain this.  Use the WITH construct to build up to the result.  To get
accurate results you should cast the operands to the division the numerator
when w is not 'Even' to double precision, for example

cast(dyeas to double precision)/(dyeas + dnays)

Integer division would truncate and the result would always be 0 or 1.  Note,
if the denominator were 0, then the yeas and nays would both be 0, so w would
be 'Even'.  Do not perform the division when the counts are equal, and you
will never divide by 0.
